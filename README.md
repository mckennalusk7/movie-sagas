# Movie List

## Description

The movie list application will allow users to see a detailed view of individual movies. Users will be able to click on movies and edit the details which will be updated to the database. Using react-router we will be able to generate through our movie list based upon movie id.

## Database Setup

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database.
3. You will need to create the junction table between the `movies` and `genres` tables!

## Install Dependencies

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm run client`

## Technology

React, Redux-Saga, PostgresSQL, Material-UI, CSS,
